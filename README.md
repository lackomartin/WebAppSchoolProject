# Web App School Project
This is hospital web application which I was created for my school project.

This app is no live, so localhost is needed to check it out. 
For this project I use XAMPP - popular PHP development environment.
Don't know how do install and use XAMPP? -> https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html

How to setup?

First of all, download or clone files in new folder and put that folder into "/xampp/htdocs".
Start Apache and MySQL modules. (xampp-control)
Then put this link into your web browser -> http://localhost/Web_aplikacija_bolnica/index.php
